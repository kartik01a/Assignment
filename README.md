1-> Run command "git clone https://github.com/kartik01a/Assignment.git"
2-> Once the projeect is cloned, you will see 2 folders frontend, backend. Run both folder in different terminals
  cd frontend then to run enter command "npm run dev"

4-> Once both frontend, backend is working fine user will see interface like in below Image
